# MyDiscordBot - Meo

A Discord bot using [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) created in my free time to learn and have fun.^^

## What can it do

- Trivial stuff like `say hi`, `send messages`, `react to messages`, ...
- Join an audio channel and stream music (can only stream one server at a time and only songs from *[songs.json](https://github.com/SxweetLollipop/Meo/blob/master/2nd/songs.json)* - which are stored in my desktop :3).
- Execute commands relevant to *[Codeforces.com](http://codeforces.com)*:
    - List all incoming contests.
    - Show information, including `rank`, `rating`, `maxRating`, `lastOnlineTime` given the handle of the user.\
More commands will be added in the future.\
*[Codeforces.com](http://codeforces.com)* server is sometimes not very responsive lately, especially during contests. At such time, commands may not work.\
- *[Beta]* Host games. Currently it can host Chess, and 3x3 Sliding Puzzle (try it~ >.^).
- And some commands I created for my own needs :3.

## Invite Meo

To invite my bot, go to *[the link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=675207704293277706&permissions=0&scope=bot)*, select the server you want to invite to, and... tada!~  
Use `'help` or refer to *[HelpModules.cs](https://github.com/SxweetLollipop/Meo/blob/master/2nd/Commands/BasicCommands/HelpModules.cs)* for full list of commands.  
The bot is currently hosted on my lap, therefore it won't be available at all time.
