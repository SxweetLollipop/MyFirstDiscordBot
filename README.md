# MyFirstDiscordBot
A Discord bot I create to learn and have fun. ^^
*v1.5:*
- Now bot can list all or a specific number of incoming CF contests. More commands of CF will be added soon.
- Help command now has better look. You should now see Puzzle game commands using *'help*.
- Re-decorated code and repo.
*v1.4:*
- Add new games: Chess, 3x3 Puzzle
Refer to *[HelpModules.cs](https://github.com/SxweetLollipop/MyFirstDiscordBot/blob/master/2nd/Commands/BasicCommands/HelpModules.cs)* or use *'help* for full list of commands.
