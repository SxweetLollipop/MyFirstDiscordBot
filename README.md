# MyDiscordBot - Meo

A Discord bot using [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) created in my free time to learn and have fun.^^

## What it does

- Trivial commands, i.e. `say hi`, `send messages`, `react to messages`, ...
- Join an audio channel and stream music (only one server at a time and only songs from *[songs.json](https://github.com/SxweetLollipop/MyFirstDiscordBot/blob/master/2nd/songs.json)* - which are stored on my desktop :3).
- Execute commands relevant to *[Codeforces.com](http://codeforces.com):*
    - List all incoming contests.
    - Show information of a user, including `rank`, `rating`, `maxRating`, `lastOnlineTime`, given the handle of the user.
    - More commands will be added in the future.
    - However, *[Codeforces.com API](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp)* is not very responsive at times, especially during contests.
- *[Beta]* Host games:
    - Games: `Chess`, `3x3 Sliding Puzzle` (try it~ >.^).
    - Has save feature.
    - Can only host one match at a time on all servers.
- And some commands created for my own needs :3.
- Many commands require a .json file called `config.json` to work. My file isn't uploaded because it contains private infos. In case you need, consider create your own one.
